# About this plugin

This plugin relies on [token based authentication][token-auth-wiki]. This requires coordination between the client and the server. [Diagrams](#extended-documentation) are included to illustrate this relationship.

This plugin was designed to work out of the box with the wonderful [devise token auth][dta] gem, but it's flexible enough to be used in just about any environment.

**About security**: [read here][so-post] for more information on securing your token auth system. The [devise token auth][dta] gem has adequate security measures in place, and this plugin was built to work seamlessly with that gem.

# Installation

Only npm is currently supported.

~~~sh
npm install redux-auth --save
~~~

You must also install and use a json loader

--

## Methods

### configure

This must be run before your app is initialized. This should be run on both the server, and on the client. The server will need an additional argument containing information about the current request's cookies and location.

##### configure arguments
* **`endpoints`**: An object containing information about your API. This at least needs to contain the full path to your URL as the `apiUrl` property. See [here](#endpoint-config-options) for a complete list of endpoint config options.
* **`settings`**: When rendering serverside, this will need to be an object that contains the following attributes:
  * **`isServer`**: A boolean that must be set to `true` when rendering server-side.
  * **`cookies`**: A string representation of the cookies from the current request. This will be parsed for any auth credentials.
  * **`location`**: A string representation of the current request's URL.

Additionaly when rendering on client side some additional settings can be passed in  **`settings`** object.
  * **`cleanSession`**: A boolean that tells if all locally stored credentials will be flushed.
  * **`clientOnly`**: A boolean that tells if code is run only on client side. Should be set `true` with only client-side usage.

##### configure example

~~~js
import { configure } from "redux-auth";

// server-side usage
store.dispatch(configure(
  {apiUrl: "https://api.graveflex.com"},
  {isServer: true, cookies, currentLocation}
)).then(({redirectPath, blank} = {}) => {
  // if `blank` is true, this is an OAuth redirect and should not
  // be rendered

  // use your server to render your app, or redirect
  // to another location if the user is unauthorized.

  // see the demo app for a more complete example.
});

// client-side usage
store.dispatch(configure(
  {apiUrl: "https://api.graveflex.com"},
  {serverSideRendering: true, cleanSession: true}
)).then(() => {
  // your store should now have the current user. now render your
  // app to the DOM. see the demo app for a more complete example.
});
~~~

--

### fetch
A wrapper around the [whatwg fetch][whatwg-fetch] implementation that automatically sends and tracks authentication headers. See [here][fetch-spec] for the complete spec.

Any requests to the API that rely on authentication will need to use the `fetch` function included in this library.

--
###### fetch example

~~~js
import { fetch } from "redux-auth";

// usage
fetch("http://api.mysite.com").then(resp => {
  alert(`Api response: `${resp}`);
});
~~~

--

# Configuration

This is the most difficult step, but only because configuring a [redux][redux] app is inherently difficult.

The following example assumes that you are familiar with redux, and that you know how to [create a store][redux-create-store]. Also keep in mind that this is a really basic example that does not even include routing. See the [demo app][redux-auth-demo] for a more complete example.

This example assumes a directory structure that looks like this:

~~~
src/
  app.js
  client.js
  server.js
~~~

##### config shared by both client and server
~~~js
// app.js
import React from "react";
import {Provider} from "react-redux";
import {configure, authStateReducer} from "redux-auth";
import {createStore, compose, applyMiddleware, combineReducers} from "redux";

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {this.props.children}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// create your main reducer
const reducer = combineReducers({
  auth: authStateReducer,
  // ... add your own reducers here
});

// create your app's store.
// note that thunk is required to use redux-auth
const store = compose(
  applyMiddleware(thunk),
  // ... add additional middleware here (router, etc.)
)(createStore)(reducer);

// a single function can be used for both client and server-side rendering.
// when run from the server, this function will need to know the cookies and
// url of the current request. also be sure to set `isServer` to true.
export function renderApp({cookies, isServer, currentLocation} = {}) {
  // configure redux-auth BEFORE rendering the page
  store.dispatch(configure(
    // use the FULL PATH to your API
    {apiUrl: "http://api.catfancy.com"},
    {isServer, cookies, currentLocation}
  )).then(({redirectPath, blank} = {}) => {
    if (blank) {
      // if `blank` is true, this is an OAuth redirect and should not
      // be rendered
      return <noscript />;
    } else {
      return (
        <Provider store={store} key="provider">
          <App />
        </Provider>
      );
    }
  });
}
~~~

##### server-side rendering configuration
~~~js
// server.js
import qs from "query-string";
import {renderToString} from "react-dom/server";
import { renderApp } from "./app";

// render the main app component into an html page
function getMarkup(appComponent) {
  var markup = renderToString(appComponent)

  return `<!doctype html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Redux Auth â€“ Isomorphic Example</title>
      </head>
    <body>
      <div id="react-root">${markup}</div>
      <script src="/path/to/my/scripts.js"></script>
    </body>
  </html>`;
}

// this function will differ depending on the serverside framework that
// you decide to use (express, hapi, etc.). The following example uses hapi
server.ext("onPreResponse", (request, reply) => {
  var query = qs.stringify(request.query);
  var currentLocation = request.path + (query.length ? "?" + query : "");
  var cookies = request.headers.cookies;

  renderApp({
    isServer: true,
    cookies,
    currentLocation
  }).then(appComponent => {
    reply(getMarkup(appComponent));
  });
}
~~~

##### client side rendering configuration

~~~js
// client.js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { renderApp } from "./app";

const reactRoot = window.document.getElementById("react-root");
renderApp().then(appComponent => {
  ReactDOM.render(appComponent, reactRoot);
});
~~~

See below for the complete list of configuration options.

# Multiple user types

This plugin allows for the use of multiple user authentication endpoint configurations. The following example assumes that the API supports two user classes, `User` and `EvilUser`. The following examples assume that `User` authentication routes are mounted at `/auth,` and the `EvilUser` authentication routes are mounted at `evil_user_auth`.

### Multiple user type configuration

When using a single user type, you will pass a single object to the `configure` method as shown in the following example.

~~~js
store.dispatch(configure({
  apiUrl: 'https://devise-token-auth.dev'
}));
~~~

When using multiple user types, you will instead pass an array of configurations, as shown in the following example.

~~~javascript
store.dispatch(configure([
  {
    default: {
      apiUrl: 'https://devise-token-auth.dev'
    }
  }, {
    evilUser: {
      apiUrl:                  'https://devise-token-auth.dev',
      signOutUrl:              '/evil_user_auth/sign_out',
      emailSignInPath:         '/evil_user_auth/sign_in',
      emailRegistrationPath:   '/evil_user_auth',
      accountUpdatePath:       '/evil_user_auth',
      accountDeletePath:       '/evil_user_auth',
      passwordResetPath:       '/evil_user_auth/password',
      passwordUpdatePath:      '/evil_user_auth/password',
      tokenValidationPath:     '/evil_user_auth/validate_token',
      authProviderPaths: {
        github:    '/evil_user_auth/github',
        facebook:  '/evil_user_auth/facebook',
        google:    '/evil_user_auth/google_oauth2'
      }
    }
  }
], {
  isServer,
  cookies,
  currentLocation
));
~~~

### Using multiple endpoints with redux-auth components

All components accept an `endpoint` attribute that will determine which of the endpoint configurations the component should use. For forms that are used by non-authenticated users users (`EmailSignInForm`, `OAuthSignInButton`, etc.), the first configuration in the endpoint config will be used as the default if this value is not provided. For forms used by authenticated users (`SignOutButton`, `UpdatePassword`, etc.), the current user's endpoint will be used by default if this value is not provided.

The following example assumes a configuration where two endpoints have been defined, `default` and `auth`:

##### Component example:
~~~js
import { EmailSignInForm } from "redux-auth/default-theme";

// within render method
<EmailSignInForm endpoint="alt" />
~~~

--

### Endpoint config options

This is the complete list of options that can be passed to the endpoint config.

~~~js
import { configure } from "redux-auth";

// ... configure store, routes, etc... //

store.dispatch(configure({
  apiUrl:                  'https://devise-token-auth.dev',
  signOutPath:             '/evil_user_auth/sign_out',
  emailSignInPath:         '/evil_user_auth/sign_in',
  emailRegistrationPath:   '/evil_user_auth',
  accountUpdatePath:       '/evil_user_auth',
  accountDeletePath:       '/evil_user_auth',
  passwordResetPath:       '/evil_user_auth/password',
  passwordUpdatePath:      '/evil_user_auth/password',
  tokenValidationPath:     '/evil_user_auth/validate_token',
  authProviderPaths: {
    github:    '/evil_user_auth/github',
    facebook:  '/evil_user_auth/facebook',
    google:    '/evil_user_auth/google_oauth2'
  }
}).then(// ... render your app ... //
